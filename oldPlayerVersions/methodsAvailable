Card
- canPlayOn: used to check if a card can be legally played on another card
- forfeitCost: used to check the points value of a card if you are holding it when you lose
- followedByCall: easier way to check if this card is a wild-type card
- getColor: returns color
- getNumber: returns number
- getRank: returns rank

GameState
?? LOOK INTO THIS MORE -- IMPORTANT
- getNumCardsInHandsOfUpcomingPlayers: return array of numbers of cards in all players' hands
- getTotalScoreOfUpcomingPlayers: get total score of all players
- getMostRecentColorCalledByUpcomingPlayers: get most recent color played by all players
- getPlayedCards: return list of all played cards (in order, I think?)

Pretty sure we can only use these two classes in our UnoPlayer and the rest aren't useful to us, but LOOK AT THIS LATER.
