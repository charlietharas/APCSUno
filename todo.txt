?? PYTHON ??
Can I make this a neural net in Python? IDK... its a lot of work
Can I make a machine learning process in Java? Probably, let's try that.

Reminder to self: more aggressive algorithm works better for now
- remember to put wild card higher because it's worth more

Algorithm outline:
Card counting:
- getPlayedCards (GameState)
	
Useful methods GameState:
- numCardsInHandsOfUpcomingPlayers
- mostRecentColorCalledByUpcomingPlayers
- totalScoreOfUpcomingPlayers

Card stuff
- can get color, rank, value, if it's a wild card, if you can play on another card
